Yesterday was college graduation! The feeling like theres no more school left feels odd, it probably really won't hit me until September when classes start back up for my friends. The day was spectacular, I had Will Ferrel tell me he will always love me thru song,  Hillary and Bill Clinton were at the ceremony for cinematic arts. After getting my diploma holder, with no diploma in it of course, I walked off stage right past them, needless to say, they smiled at me. I can of course know even though it was super dark in that area of the theater, but yeah, I met Hillary and Bill :)! Then there was a full afternoon of hugs, handshakes, and a genuine want to just get that itchy robe off. Now I prepare to travel to London, awesome! Im officially a USC Graduate. Alumni Life here I come!
