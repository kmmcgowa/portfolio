      <description>Over the weekend The School of Cinematic Arts published an Alumni Profile about my post graduation experience, enjoy the first paragraph below or find the full article on the SCA website.
Kevin McGowan graduated among the first cohort of the Media Arts+Practice division at the USC School of Cinematic Arts in May 2017. A life-long Trojan fan from Palos Verdes, McGowan always aspired to attending SCA. However, the MA+P program was a surprise.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now a week after returning from Europe. London is AMAZING, I so desperately want to live there at some point in my life, at least have a second home there. Luckily this year, my mum did not make us go to all the famous land marks that typically make up the city. This trip was spent mainly at contemporary locations around the city and historical place just outside. We did a tour at Oxford University day 2.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was college graduation! The feeling like theres no more school left feels odd, it probably really won&amp;rsquo;t hit me until September when classes start back up for my friends. The day was spectacular, I had Will Ferrel tell me he will always love me thru song, Hillary and Bill Clinton were at the ceremony for cinematic arts. After getting my diploma holder, with no diploma in it of course, I walked off stage right past them, needless to say, they smiled at me.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now Tuesday May 2nd. The thesis showcase is in 6 days and the project is almost&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; there. Not really though. It seems as though with every step of the process I have to spend more money and more time on things I budgeted as being far less in the beginning. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I spent all the time to plan it out, but this being my first real, large project, I was of course wrong.</description>

      <title>Playing with RFID</title>

      <description>The thesis project is in full swing now as the various tech starts to arrive for production. The groundwork has been set and its soldering time. In total some 10 RFID sensor chips will be set up in an array to read all of the blocks played in the playground. I have luckily found a library that will make interfacing with the chip extremely easy, and interfacing with all at once should be no more difficult than 2 in sync.</description>

      <title>Thesis Design Brief</title>

      <description>To reach the ultimate goal of this project took an awful lot of &amp;lsquo;soul searching&amp;rsquo; would be the best estimate I could give. I approached the assignment by creating lists of things that interested me; these included things such as building physical object, anything BIG, and lots of coding involved. Combined these are aspects that would end up creating a project that I would enjoy working on and would hopefully be revolutionary.</description>
